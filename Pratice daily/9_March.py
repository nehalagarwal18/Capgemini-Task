'''
Class and object

class:-
->A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
It defines:
->Attributes (variables) → data
->Methods (functions) → behavior

Object:-
->An object is an instance of a class.
->It represents a real-world entity created using a class.

Constructor:
->In Python, a constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It is mainly used to initialize the object's attributes (variables).
->In Python, the constructor method is called __init__().

class method:
->In Python, a class method is a method that is bound to the class rather than the object.
->It works with the class itself, not with individual instances (objects).
->To create a class method, Python uses the @classmethod decorator.


static method:
->A static method in Python is a method that belongs to a class but does not use the class (cls) or object (self).
->It is defined using the @staticmethod decorator.
->Static methods are usually used for utility functions that are related to a class but do not need access to class or instance data.
